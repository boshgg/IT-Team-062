JAVA: Our team members are familiar with Java, also Java support cross-platform.Java has many advantages, we have taken a fancy to some of them, so we chose Java as our programming language, it is an object-oriented programming language. The advantage is that it has high portability. The original design was designed to be written once and executed everywhere. Can develop various applications and games, and it can cross the platform 

database: SQLite

SQLite: SQLite is a small database, most of the android application use SQLite to store data.SQLite can embedded directly into the android application, easy to build up and operate database.  Can be combined with many programming languages at the same time. Also faster than MySQL and PostgreSQL, two of the world’s most popular open source database management systems.

This is the most basic version of the App. It has a login page. You can only enter the software by using the preset account password. (This is a local database management software, which cannot be used for networking and registering a new account. The account is created and assigned by the company) If the account and password are entered incorrectly. A window will pop up to inform you that login failed. After the login is successful, it will jump directly to the customer list page. Through the plus button in the lower right corner, you can add new customer information (including name, birthday, and age (only numbers can be entered for age). The current functions include updating and adding customer information. The delete function is still in the production process. In addition, the function of individually adding interactive record information to each customer is also under consideration and production.
