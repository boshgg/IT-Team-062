Version 1.0 2021.9.17

This is the most basic version of the App. It has a login page. You can only enter the software by using the preset account password. (This is a local database management software, which cannot be used for networking and registering a new account. The account is created and assigned by the company) If the account and password are entered incorrectly. A window will pop up to inform you that login failed. After the login is successful, it will jump directly to the customer list page. Through the plus button in the lower right corner, you can add new customer information (including name, birthday, and age (only numbers can be entered for age). The current functions include updating and adding customer information. The delete function is still in the production process. In addition, the function of individually adding interactive record information to each customer is also under consideration and production.

Adding the function of deleting customers, adding the function of deleting all customers, adding the display effect of empty list, adding gender to the default display, and adding animation of scrolling the list.

Added search function. Administrators can search by name to obtain customer information. 
The birthday selection function has been added, and now the month and date can be selected directly through the visual calendar. 
The notification function is added. After the administrator enters the program, there will be a pop-up window to remind the administrator that the customer’s birthday is approaching.
